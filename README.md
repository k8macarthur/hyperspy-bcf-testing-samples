README

Sample files to test the bcf implementation to hyperspy.

Some samples are real pieces of rock from Sudetes Mountains in Central Europe while other
are generated on Bruker Esprit 1.9.4 demo version.

The generated samples used Scripting capabilities (Ctrl+F2 in Esprit 1.9.4) to set the global image size below minimal possible size throught GUI (100x100), I.e. 4x3 pixels, thus extremelly helping out with RE.

Some samples have both ripple and bcf version.

The real samples are listed here, copyrights are granted:

P50 - sample from the Kłodzko-Złoty Stok granitoid massif.




#Please
If somebody would like to share the sample file generated with other versions of Esprit do not hestitate to push them there.
